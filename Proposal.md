Lab 1 Project Porpoisal

The names of everyone in your group
  
  - Pip
  
  - Cece
  
The additional feature(s) you plan on implementing

  - Have a login-authetication with an API like facebook or google.
  
  - Store your appâ€™s data in Firebase. This will make it persistent across phones as well!
  
  - ~~absolutely no easter eggs~~
  
  - Fingerprint login (very stretch goal)
  
The name of the git repo username/RepoNamo you will be using (you should make a new one)
  
  - segerphilip/HomeSlice
  
A quick write up on how you plan to divide up work and integrate features.

  - Pair programming to build base framework 
  
  - From that point, work will be split up in a reasonable way (i.e. between different fragments/activities)
  
  - Pip will help teach Cecelia about design
  
Where you plan to be in a week (Mon Oct 10) We will be doing informal check-ins to monitor your progress.
  
  - Done with most of the core coding, but will still need to:
  
    - Integrate some code that we did independently over the weekend
    
    - Make it pretty (even more purty) (Cecelia will add some purty things that Pip showed her how to make)
